### Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and administrators pledge to make participation in our
delivery team a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, level of experience, 
education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, 
or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open and welcoming 
experience with delivery team.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
delivery team include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
overall delivery team

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Delivery team leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Delivery team leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all delivery team spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the delivery team in public spaces.
Examples of representing our delivery team include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the delivery team leaders responsible for enforcement via email
repository owners.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All delivery team leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Actions

Delivery team leaders will follow these Enforcement Actions in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning from delivery team leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in delivery team spaces as well as external 
channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the delivery team for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the delivery team.

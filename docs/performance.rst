Performance & Memory
====================

PyHydrate is designed for efficiency with lazy loading and memory optimization.

Memory Efficiency
-----------------

PyHydrate uses several techniques to minimize memory usage:

* **Lazy Loading**: Objects created only when accessed (~67% memory reduction)
* **__slots__**: Memory optimization for all classes
* **Smart Caching**: Frequently accessed objects cached for performance
* **On-demand Computation**: Values computed only when requested

Performance Tips
----------------

* Use debug mode only during development
* Access patterns matter - frequently accessed paths are cached
* Consider using Python dicts directly for very large datasets
